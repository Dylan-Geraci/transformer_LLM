  "What are the core courses required for a computer science undergraduate degree?": {
    "prompt": "You are an assistant specialized in answering questions using the provided excerpts from a university CS handbook.\n\nCONTEXT:\nerequisites for some upper-division CS courses.\n23\n\n4.2 Minor Prerequisite Tree\nCPSC 120\nCPSC 121\nCPSC 131\nCPSC elective 1 CPSC elective 2\n4.3 For Majors in Related Fields\nAs stated above, at least 12 units, including the minimum 6 units of upper division course work, must be courses that\nare not being used to fulfill requirements for your major. This has implications for students whose major includes\nsome CPSC courses.\nComputer Engineering Major and Computer Science Minor\nThe Computer Engineering major includes CPSC 120, 121, 131, 253U, and 351, so none of these count toward the 12-\nunit requirement. A Computer Engineering major may count only 3 of these units toward a Computer Science minor.\nTo complete the minor they must pass at least 12 additional units of CPSC courses that are distinct from their major.\nAltogether, a Computer Engineering major must usually pass a total of 25 units of CPSC course work to complete a\nComputer Science minor.\nElectrical Engineering Major and Computer Science minor\nThe Electrical Engineering major includes CPSC 120, so CPSC 120 does not count toward the 12-unit requirement.\nHowever, the remaining 12 units of minor courses ordinarily do not count toward the Electrical Engineering major, so\nElectrical Engineering majors typically only need to pass 15 units of CPSC courses to complete a Computer Science\nminor.\nInformation Systems and Decision Sciences and Computer Science Double Majors\nThe Information Systems and Decision Sciences major includes ISDS 309, which is not equivalent to any CPSC\ncourse.\n24\n\n5\nAlternative Pathways\n5.1 Transfer\nIf you are a transfer student from a California Community College, you should refer to http://www.assist.org .\nA department adviser can help you with these equivalencies and give the required approval.\nTransfer courses cannot be applied toward the major or accepted as prerequisites until they are recorded in the Titan\nDegree Audit (TDA) system. You should have your official transcripts sent to the office of Admissions. see http:\n//admissions.fullerton.edu/prospectivestudent/college_transcripts.php for more in-\nformation.\nTo find articulation agreements in the assist.org database, start by loading the web page http://www.assist.\norg, as shown below.\n25\n\nSelect the institution you’d like to transfer from; in this example we will use Irvine Valley College (IVC).\nThen indicate that you are transferring toCSUF.\nFinally, indicate that you are interested in courses relevant to the Computer Science major.\n26\n\nThe text within the scroll bars shows established articulations between CSUF and IVC. For instance, IVC CS 36 is\nequivalent to CSUF CPSC 120.\nIf you explore the page, you will see that IVC offers equivalents for all of the required lower-division CS courses. IVC\nCS 36, 37, 41, 38, 40A, and 40B articulate to CPSC 120, 121, 131, 223J, and 240, which are the entirety of the Lower-\nDivision Core courses. IVC MATH 3A, 3B, 30, and 31 articulate to CSUF MATH 150A, 150B, 270A, and 270B,\nwhich are all Mathematics Requirements except MATH 338. IVC PHYS 4A, PHYS 4B, and MATH 4A articulate to\n27\n\nCSUF PHYS 225, 225L, 226, 226L, and MATH 250A, which together satisfy the Science and Mathematics Electives\nrequirement.\n5.2 Computer Science Placement Examination\nOur courses CPSC 120 and CPSC 121 cover computer programming. If you are proficient in this material, but do\nnot have academic credit, you may attempt to\n\ncourse with a laboratory\nexperience. Eligible laboratory courses are designated in the Catalog.\nChoose a set of courses that support each other and your future studies. Plan ahead, and discuss your plan for this\nrequirement with your adviser.\nTIPPHYS 225, 225L, 226, 226L, and MATH 250A provide a strong foundation for later CS courses,\nmeet all Science and Mathematics requirements, and fit within 12 units. Take this set of electives\nunless you are working toward a specific study plan focusing on biology, chemistry, geology, or\nmathematics.\nThe two-semester biology sequence is BIOL 151 and BIOL 152. This sequence replaced older courses numbered\nBIOL 171 and 172. Current students should take 151 and 152, but you may see references to 171 and 172 in some\ndocuments. Students who took 171 and 172 while they were offered may count those courses toward the Science and\nMathematics Electives requirement.\n3.7 Upper Division Core\nCPSC 491 - Senior Capstone Project in Computer Science is the Core course with the longest chain of prerequisites.\nPlan your schedule so that you make steady progress toward meeting 491’s prerequisites.\nTIPIf possible, make progress on each of the following prerequisite chains every semester:\n1. CPSC 120, 121, 131, 362, 490, 491\n2. MATH 270A, 270B\n3. MATH 150A, 150B, 338\n16\n\n3.8 Computer Science Major Electives\nYou must select 15 units of electives, ordinarily five 3-unit courses, to satisfy your degree requirements. Select elective\ncourses that are best aligned with your personal objectives. For example, if you aspire to create web applications and\nmobile apps, then courses such as CPSC 411, CPSC 411A, CPSC 431, CPSC 349 and CPSC 449 are excellent choices.\nConsult mentors and advisors in selecting the elective courses that match your goals.\nCourses outside of the computer science department may be used as elective courses. You must seek approval from a\nmajor advisor before taking the course.\nComputer science related internship may be approved for 3 units of elective course. You must enroll in EGGN 495 to\nreceive the credits. Independent Study can also be counted for elective credits. You must enroll in CPSC 499 under\nthe supervision of a faculty advisor.\n3.8.1 Lower Division CS Electives\nYou may complete at most 3.0 units of Lower Division CS Electives (200 level courses). Students who need additional\nunits due to the Placement Examination, transfer, or other circumstances are encouraged to consult with a major\nadvisor.\n3.8.2 Upper Division CS Electives\nYour are required to complete at least 12.0 units of Upper Division CS Electives. You may need to take additional\nelectives if you are short on units due to the Placement Examination, transfer, or other circumstances.\nA course may be used as an Upper Division CS Elective if it is a 3-unit, 300/400 level CPSC course that is not a core\nrequirement. Therefore, the following courses may count as Upper Division CS Electives:\n• CPSC 301 - Programming Lab Practicum (2)\n• CPSC 349 - Web Front-End Engineering (3)\n• CPSC 375 - Introduction to Data Science and Big Data (3)\n• CPSC 386 - Introduction to Game Design and Production (3)\n• CPSC 411 - Mobile Device Application Programming (3)\n• CPSC 411A - Mobile Device Application Programming for Android (3)\n• CPSC 431 - Database and Applications (3)\n• CPSC 439 - Theory of Computation (3)\n• CPSC 440 - Computer System Architecture (3)\n• CPSC\n\nize the number of waiting lists their name\nappears on. This signals to the Department office that you are able to attend the course. The use of proxies (asking\nfriends to attend the class for you) is prohibited and is considered an act of academic dishonesty.\n30\n\n5.10 Request Forms\nThe TDA software system usually does a good job of automatically tracking your completion of major and minor\nrequirements. Unfortunately, though, it may mishandle exceptional circumstances, such as a transfer from a university\non the quarter system. If your TDA is inaccurate, you need to ask the Department to correct your TDA manually.\nThere are three forms that you can use to request that the Department adjust your TDA.\n1. Use the Domestic Course Articulation Request to ask the Department whether courses from another college or\nuniversity in the United States can count toward Computer Science major or minor requirements.\n2. Use the International Course Articulation Request to ask whether courses from a college or university in a\ndifferent country can count toward Computer Science major or minor requirements.\n3. Use the Undergraduate Course Reallocation Request form to ask the Department to reallocate a course that\nappears on your TDA which does not appear in the correct category. This may happen if you have taken an\nadvisor-approved elective which was not automatically recognized by the TDA software, you have changed\ncatalog years, or courses transferred from another institution appear uncatagorized or the incorrect category.\nAnother common case is when you take a course that was created after your catalog year. For example, CS 223C\nand the cybersecurity courses are new courses that do not appear on the 2007 or 2011 TDAs. Use Undergraduate\nCourse Reallocation Request to count these courses towards your degree.\nBlank forms are available at http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/resources/documents.php , or as\nhard-copies in the Department office. To file a request, submit a completed hard-copy form to the Department office\nor email to csoffice@fullerton.edu. The request will typically be processed within ten business days. The outcome of\nthe request will be communicated to the applicant through an Advising Note in the applicant’s TDA. The Department\nChair or designee has sole discretion to approve or deny these requests and those decisions are final and non-negotiable.\n31\n\n32\n\n6\nAdvisement\nIt can be frustrating to find out that you took a class that wasn’t useful for your course of study. Not being able to\ntake a class when you want because of a needed prerequisite is even worse—it slows your progress and can delay your\ngraduation. To avoid problems like these, the University offers advisement counseling to all students. This is your\nopportunity to review your progress toward your degree and to discuss electives that match your career goals.\nDeveloping the skills in identifying and connecting with formal and informal advisors and mentors is a skill that\nstudents need to develop. Set a goal for yourself to find mentors who will support you and keep you motivated on your\npath through the university.\n6.1 General Advice\nAny student who wishes to discuss any concern may contact the Student Success Center. Find out cpntact information\nhere: http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/resources/StudentSuccessCenter.php\n6.2 Major Advisement\nStudents may seek major advising from major advisors in the computer science department and through the ECS\nStudent Success Center.\nThe Student Success Center on the second floor of the Computer Science Building can answer many of your questions\nregarding General Education as well. They are located in room CS 201. Their phone number is 657-278-3879. Their\nweb site is https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/resources/StudentSuccessCenter.php\nComputer Science department advisors are members of the faculty and you may schedule an appointment to see one\nby contacting the department office. The contact information for the department is in Section 1.2. The following web-\npage provides the Academic Advisement information http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/resources/\nadvisement.php\n33\n\n6.3 Required Advisement\nThe College of Engineering and Computer Science places a registration hold on all undergraduate students once a year\nto ensure the student meets with\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat are the core courses required for a computer science undergraduate degree?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Answer succinctly and refer to the handbook when appropriate.

If your TDA is inaccurate, you need to ask the Department to correct your TDA manually.\nThere are three forms that you can use to request that the Department adjust your TDA.\n1. Use the Domestic Course Articulation Request to ask the Department whether courses from another college or\nuniversity in the United States can count toward Computer Science major or minor requirements.\n2. Use the International Course Articulation Request to ask whether courses from a college or university in a\ndifferent country can count toward Computer Science major or minor requirements.\n3. Use the Undergraduate Course Reallocation Request form to ask the Department to reallocate a course that\nappears on your TDA which does not appear in the correct category. This may happen if you have taken an\nadvisor-approved elective which was not automatically recognized by the TDA software, you have changed\ncatalog years, or courses transferred from another institution appear uncatagorized or the incorrect category.\nAnother common case is when you take a course that was created after your catalog year. For example, CS 223C\nand the cybersecurity courses are new courses that do not appear on the 2007 or 2011 TDAs.

To file a request, submit a completed hard-copy form to the Department office\nor email to csoffice@fullerton.edu. The request will typically be processed within ten business days. The outcome of\nthe request will be communicated to the applicant through an Advising Note in the applicant’s TDA. The Department\nChair or designee has sole discretion to approve or deny these requests and those decisions are final and non-negotiable.\n31\n\n32\n\n6\nAdvisement\nIt can be frustrating to find out that you took a class that wasn’t useful for your course of study. Not being able to\ntake a class when you want because of a needed prerequisite is even worse—it slows your progress and can delay your\ngraduation. To avoid problems like these, the University offers advisement counseling to all students. This is your\nopportunity to review your progress toward your degree and to discuss electives that match your career goals.\nDeveloping the skills in identifying and connecting with formal and informal advisors and mentors is a skill that\nstudents need to develop.

This has implications for students whose major includes\nsome CPSC courses.\nComputer Engineering Major and Computer Science Minor\nThe Computer Engineering major includes CPSC 120, 121, 131, 253U, and 351, so none of these count toward the 12-\nunit requirement. A Computer Engineering major may count only 3 of these units toward a Computer Science minor.\nTo complete the minor they must pass at least 12 additional units of CPSC courses that are distinct from their major.\nAltogether, a Computer Engineering major must usually pass a total of 25 units of CPSC course work to complete a\nComputer Science minor.\nElectrical Engineering Major and Computer Science minor\nThe Electrical Engineering major includes CPSC 120, so CPSC 120 does not count toward the 12-unit requirement.\nHowever, the remaining 12 units of minor courses ordinarily do not count toward the Electrical Engineering major, so\nElectrical Engineering majors typically only need to pass 15 units of CPSC courses to complete a Computer Science\nminor.\nInformation Systems and Decision Sciences and Computer Science Double Majors\nThe Information Systems and Decision Sciences major includes ISDS 309, which is not equivalent to any CPSC\ncourse.\n24\n\n5\nAlternative Pathways\n5.1 Transfer\nIf you are a transfer student from a California Community College, you should refer to http://www.assist.org .\nA department adviser can help you with these equivalencies and give the required approval.\nTransfer courses cannot be applied toward the major or accepted as prerequisites until they are recorded in the Titan\nDegree Audit (TDA) system. You should have your official transcripts sent to the office of Admissions. see http:\n//admissions.fullerton.edu/prospectivestudent/college_transcripts.php for more in-\nformation.\nTo find articulation agreements in the assist.org database, start by loading the web page http://www.assist.\norg, as shown below.\n25\n\nSelect the institution you’d like to transfer from; in this example we will use Irvine Valley College (IVC).\nThen indicate that you are transferring toCSUF.\nFinally, indicate that you are interested in courses relevant to the Computer Science major.\n26\n\nThe text within the scroll bars shows established articulations between CSUF and IVC.

The use of proxies (asking\nfriends to attend the class for you) is prohibited and is considered an act of academic dishonesty.\n30\n\n5.10 Request Forms\nThe TDA software system usually does a good job of automatically tracking your completion of major and minor\nrequirements. Unfortunately, though, it may mishandle exceptional circumstances, such as a transfer from a university\non the quarter system. If your TDA is inaccurate, you need to ask the Department to correct your TDA manually.\nThere are three forms that you can use to request that the Department adjust your TDA.\n1. Use the Domestic Course Articulation Request to ask the Department whether courses from another college or\nuniversity in the United States can count toward Computer Science major or minor requirements.\n2. Use the International Course Articulation Request to ask whether courses from a college or university in a\ndifferent country can count toward Computer Science major or minor requirements.\n3. Use the Undergraduate Course Reallocation Request form to ask the Department to reallocate a course that\nappears on your TDA which does not appear in the correct category. This may happen if you have taken an\nadvisor-approved elective which was not automatically recognized by the TDA software, you have changed\ncatalog years, or courses transferred from another institution appear uncatagorized or the incorrect category.\nAnother common case is when you take a course that was created after your catalog year. For example, CS 223C\nand the cybersecurity courses are new courses that do not appear on the 2007 or 2011 TDAs. Use Undergraduate\nCourse Reallocation Request to count these courses towards your degree.\nBlank forms are available at http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/resources/documents.php , or as\nhard-copies in the Department office. To file a request, submit a completed hard-copy form to the Department office\nor email to csoffice@fullerton.edu. The request will typically be processed within ten business days. The outcome of\nthe request will be communicated to the applicant through an Advising Note in the applicant’s TDA. The Department\nChair or designee has sole discretion to approve or deny these requests and those decisions are final and non-negotiable.\n31\n\n32\n\n6\nAdvisement\nIt can be frustrating to find out that you took a class that wasn’t useful for your course of study. Not being able to\ntake a class when you want because of a needed prerequisite is even worse—it slows your progress and can delay your\ngraduation. To avoid problems like these, the University offers advisement counseling to all students. This is your\nopportunity to review your progress toward your degree and to discuss electives that match your career goals.\nDeveloping the skills in identifying and connecting with formal and informal advisors and mentors is a skill that\nstudents need to develop. Set a goal for yourself to find mentors who will support you and keep you motivated on your\npath through the university.\n6.1 General Advice\nAny student who wishes to discuss any concern may contact the Student Success Center. Find out cpntact information\nhere: http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/resources/StudentSuccessCenter.php\n6.2 Major Advisement\nStudents may seek major advising from major advisors in the computer science department and through the ECS\nStudent Success Center.\nThe Student Success Center on the second floor of the Computer Science Building can answer many of your questions\nregarding General Education as well. They are located in room CS 201. Their phone number is 657-278-3879. Their\nweb site is https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/resources/StudentSuccessCenter.php\nComputer Science department advisors are members of the faculty and you may schedule an appointment to see one\nby contacting the department office. The contact information for the department is in Section 1.2. The following web-\npage provides the Academic Advisement information http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/resources/\nadvisement.php\n33\n\n6.3 Required Advisement\nThe College of Engineering and Computer Science places a registration hold on all undergraduate students once a year\nto ensure the student meets with\n\n. Details of the project.\n2. Tasks the student was primarily responsible for.\n3. What the student learned from the project he/she completed.\n4. How the project benefited the student from an academic standpoint.\nBenefits of the internship program in Computer Science include:\n• Industrial work experience.\n• Job placement assistance from the Center for Internships & Community Engagement (CICE)\n(http://www.fullerton.edu/cice/students/internships.php ).\n• Up to 3 units of credit.\nWe recommend that you consider an internship when you reach junior or senior status.\nTo register for an internship, follow the instructions at CICE’s website\n(http://www.fullerton.edu/cice/students/internships.php ).\nThe ECS students must follow the ECS Internship process https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/resources/\necs-academic-internship.php\n5.6 International Students\nInternational students must obtain a CPT I-20 form from the International Education and Exchange office in UH-244.\nCheck with IEE for admissible dates prior to completing the CICE Registration.\n29\n\n5.7 ROTC\nComputer Science majors interested in joining the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program should schedule\na long appointment (30 minutes) with an advisor in their freshman year to map out the complete study plan. Prior to\nthe meeting, the student must obtain the proper documents from ROTC office located in MS-101 (Military Science\nBuilding room 101) and bring those documents with them to the advising session.\n5.8 Independent Study\nYou may take CPSC 499 Independent Study as an Upper Division CS Elective. This course allows you to pursue a\ntopic that is not covered by any regular course, under the supervision of a faculty advisor.\nAll independent study applications must be approved by the study’s faculty advisor and department chair by the end\nof the semester prior to the proposal’s start date. That means independent study proposals for the Fall are due in by\nthe end of the previous Spring semester, and proposals for the Spring are due in the previous Fall semester.\nYou must submit an Independent Study Application to the department office, which will supply the form. As stated\non the form, the Application must be accompanied by a study plan which includes the study’s objective(s), the study’s\noutcome(s), a 16 week study plan, the basis for evaluation, and the date(s) that student work is due. A template is\navailable at http://csufcs.com/isplan .\nYou may take up to three units per semester, and apply a maximum of six units towards the degree.\nYou will not be able to register for this course until the Department grants you permission to do so. You should contact\nthe Department to verify that this has been done.\nGraduate students may not entroll in CPSC 499. Graduate students interested in self-directed study should consider\nCPSC 597, 598, or 599 instead.\n5.9 Petitioning for Classes\nWhen a class is closed because all the seats in the class are full, a student may petition to add the course once the\nsemester begins. This is where a student attends the class and places his or her name on the paper waiting list that the\ninstructor passes out in class.\nThe Titan Online waiting lists, also called the electronic waiting lists, have no impact on the petitioning process and\nthe Department’s paper waiting lists.\nThe paper waiting lists are returned to the CS Department Office and the Department attempts to enroll as many\nstudents as possible, giving priority to those closest to graduation. This process does not guarantee enrolling in the\ndesired course.\nStudents are encouraged to attend as many classes as possible to maximize the number of waiting lists their name\nappears on. This signals to the Department office that you are able to attend the course. The use of proxies (asking\nfriends to attend the class for you) is prohibited and is considered an act of academic dishonesty.\n30\n\n5.10 Request Forms\nThe TDA software system usually does a good job of automatically tracking your completion of major and minor\nrequirements.

This has implications for students whose major includes\nsome CPSC courses.\nComputer Engineering Major and Computer Science Minor\nThe Computer Engineering major includes CPSC 120, 121, 131, 253U, and 351, so none of these count toward the 12-\nunit requirement. A Computer Engineering major may count only 3 of these units toward a Computer Science minor.\nTo complete the minor they must pass at least 12 additional units of CPSC courses that are distinct from their major.\nAltogether, a Computer Engineering major must usually pass a total of 25 units of CPSC course work to complete a\nComputer Science minor.\nElectrical Engineering Major and Computer Science minor\nThe Electrical Engineering major includes CPSC 120, so CPSC 120 does not count toward the 12-unit requirement.\nHowever, the remaining 12 units of minor courses ordinarily do not count toward the Electrical Engineering major, so\nElectrical Engineering majors typically only need to pass 15 units of CPSC courses to complete a Computer Science\nminor.\nInformation Systems and Decision Sciences and Computer Science Double Majors\nThe Information Systems and Decision Sciences major includes ISDS 309, which is not equivalent to any CPSC\ncourse.\n24\n\n5\nAlternative Pathways\n5.1 Transfer\nIf you are a transfer student from a California Community College, you should refer to http://www.assist.org .\nA department adviser can help you with these equivalencies and give the required approval.\nTransfer courses cannot be applied toward the major or accepted as prerequisites until they are recorded in the Titan\nDegree Audit (TDA) system. You should have your official transcripts sent to the office of Admissions. see http:\n//admissions.fullerton.edu/prospectivestudent/college_transcripts.php for more in-\nformation.\nTo find articulation agreements in the assist.org database, start by loading the web page http://www.assist.\norg, as shown below.\n25\n\nSelect the institution you’d like to transfer from; in this example we will use Irvine Valley College (IVC).\nThen indicate that you are transferring toCSUF.\nFinally, indicate that you are interested in courses relevant to the Computer Science major.\n26\n\nThe text within the scroll bars shows established articulations between CSUF and IVC. For instance, IVC CS 36 is\nequivalent to CSUF CPSC 120.\nIf you explore the page, you will see that IVC offers equivalents for all of the required lower-division CS courses. IVC\nCS 36, 37, 41, 38, 40A, and 40B articulate to CPSC 120, 121, 131, 223J, and 240, which are the entirety of the Lower-\nDivision Core courses. IVC MATH 3A, 3B, 30, and 31 articulate to CSUF MATH 150A, 150B, 270A, and 270B,\nwhich are all Mathematics Requirements except MATH 338. IVC PHYS 4A, PHYS 4B, and MATH 4A articulate to\n27\n\nCSUF PHYS 225, 225L, 226, 226L, and MATH 250A, which together satisfy the Science and Mathematics Electives\nrequirement.\n5.2 Computer Science Placement Examination\nOur courses CPSC 120 and CPSC 121 cover computer programming.
